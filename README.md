## Iot Devices Network Anomany Detection using Machine Learning


As the proliferation of smart devices and the Internet continues, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become an integral part of our daily lives and industrial operations. IoT technologies enable manufacturing companies to monitor the
status of machines in real-time, assess product quality, and track environmental conditions within production facilities. This capability not only reduces the risk of damage and loss but
also empowers managers to make informed decisions from
a comprehensive perspective. Moreover, IoT has transformed
consumer lifestyles and behaviors, with an increasing reliance
on IoT devices and services. However, the presence of anomalies
in IoT networks can pose significant security and safety
challenges, necessitating robust mechanisms for their detection
and resolution to prevent potential damages. In this paper, we
propose an advanced approach using machine learning (ML)
techniques to enhance the security framework of IoT networks.
Our methodology involves the deployment of multiple ML models,
including Logistic Regression,Naive Bayes, Random Forest,
Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer Perceptron and XG Boost
to detect and classify anomalous traffic behaviors within IoT
networks effectively. The experimental analysis is conducted
using the IoT Network Intrusion Dataset-Hk Security, focusing
on model efficiency and the identification of optimal strategies
for real-time anomaly detection. We aim to demonstrate the
effectiveness of these models in improving IoT network security,
thereby mitigating risks and enhancing operational reliability
